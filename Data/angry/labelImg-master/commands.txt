Thanx @trinhthanhhoakg. It works perfectly. For my English speaking friends. It's like follows.

You should have python3.

clone git@github.com:tzutalin/labelImg.git -> pip3 install labelImg -> Go to cloned project folder -> python labelImg.py
If it works you are good to go.

Else you will get error
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "labelImg.py", line 30, in
from libs.resources import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'libs.resources'

Then execute "pyrcc5 -o libs/resources.py resources.qrc" OR "pyrcc5 -o libs/resources.py resources.qrc OR both."

Again try "python labelImg.py"
